# Endangered Animals Slide Game

<p>
  I created a slide game showcasing endangered animals and information about them. To try the game download 
  EndangeredAnimals.exe and run it. This is a simple game where the picture gets scrambled and your goal is
  to unscramble it. Click on one of the 4 squares around the black box to swap it with the black box. If you 
  want to spend an hour playing a slide game try it on hard! Otherwise, I would suggest playing it on easy.
